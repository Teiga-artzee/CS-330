How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I write out the high level functions I need the software to perform. Create UML's to understand the flow of the software, write out and break down the mathimatics behind what I need done, and making the software as simple and clean as is necessary. Doing so, when an issue occurs, it is easy to understand where the problem is located and I can quickly begin to debug my code.


How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs requires making it reusable where applicable, maintainable with easy to understand variables, functions, and comments, and testing it in portions to prevent large bugs that are hard to find.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This computer graphics course taught me the fundamentals of how to communicate with my hardwares graphics card, as well as the skill of perserverance, as this course has been the most difficult course as my time as a student, and I will take that with me, learning to continue to work hard and continue on in the face of hard and difficult challenges. A skill needed for when working in computer science, as solving problems and learning new ways to overcome challenegs is what it is about.
